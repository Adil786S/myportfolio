<b>Hi! Iâ€™m Shaikh Adil</b>, a passionate B.Tech student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from Parbhani, Maharashtra, with a deep love for coding and technology. <br>
Though my core field is Electrical and Electronics, I have developed a strong interest in software development, especially in Python Full Stack Development. <br>I enjoy blending my knowledge of electronics with coding to build smart, real-world solutions. <br>
Currently, Iâ€™m honing my programming skills, exploring web development, and balancing my academics with practical experience at Desai Enterprises. <br>I believe in continuous learning, and I'm always curious about new tools, frameworks, and technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible. <br>
I'm a fast learner, dedicated, and driven by values like honesty, loyalty, and growth. <br>Whether itâ€™s in the lab, in code, or in life â€” I strive to keep evolving. <br>
